E-Waste Management Web App
Apovlita
Greek for ‘waste’

Website aimed at revolutionising how we deal with our electronic waste (e-waste)

 E-waste recycling relies on the effort of the consumer, to take their non-functional items to a deposit point or center to be recycled. 

With Apovlita, consumers will only have to request collection of their items.

Not only that - consumers will receive kick-back on all their recycled items.
